# Anki vocabulary decks generator
The aim is to generate Anki decks for learning North Frisian but I'll try to keep it general enough that it would be easy to use for other languages as well.

At the moment the decks are generated from [this Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WThbHIfG1n0XsOx5lN47h0GI-EluMkFzc_h72JpsWLs/edit#gid=0).
Other data sources might follow or even replace this sheet in the future.

The decks can be built using the "Build decks" action and subsequently downloaded.

Currently, there is only a single deck for learning vocabulary of the Mooring variant of North Frisian using German as a base. An English variant might follow in the future.
